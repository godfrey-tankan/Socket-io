# Socket-io
Socket.IO is a powerful library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.

-Real-time messaging: Socket.IO allows instant and bidirectional communication between the server and clients. 
It enables real-time messaging, allowing users to send and receive messages instantly without the need for page refreshes.

-Broadcasting messages: Socket.IO supports broadcasting messages, which means that when a user sends a message, the server can distribute it to all connected clients in real time. 
This ensures that all participants in the chat room receive the messages simultaneously.

Presence detection: Socket.IO provides features for presence detection, allowing you to know which users are currently online or offline. 
This can be useful for displaying user presence indicators or generating user lists in the chat app.

-Typing indicators: With Socket.IO, you can implement typing indicators, so when a user starts typing a message, other participants in the chat room can be notified in real time. 
This feature enhances the user experience and provides real-time feedback.

-Room management: Socket.IO enables the creation and management of chat rooms or channels. 
Users can join specific rooms, and messages can be sent and received within those rooms.
This allows for group chats or private conversations.

-Emojis and attachments: Socket.IO can handle the transfer of emojis, files, images, and other attachments in real time.
Users can share media or files within the chat app seamlessly.

Notifications: Socket.IO can be used to send notifications to connected clients.
For example, you can notify users when they receive new messages or when someone mentions them in a chat conversation.
